# ProgettoSIV

#### Basketball tracking
The project consists in finding and tracing the position of a basketball shot from the free throw line.

#### TODO
 - [ ] Custom parameters for each video (file parameter_utils.py)
 - [ ] calculate_curve() in motion_tracking.py sometimes catches wrong y position  
    (es. video 10)
 - [x] Try to make work evaluate_shot() somehow
 - [x] Division by zero check in calculate_curve()
